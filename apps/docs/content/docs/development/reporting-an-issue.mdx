# Reporting an issue

As the project is still in early stages and is under heavy development, the issues may occur. In such cases, here are some tips and guidelines how to properly report an issue and ensure that it gets the attention it deserves.

1. Check if the issue is already reported on our [GitHub Issues][github-issues] tracker. If it is, add a comment to the existing issue.
2. If it is rather a question than a issue, please create a [GitHub Discussion][github-discussions].
3. Always provide output from **nefi** with the [--verbose] flag. This ensures that the team can quickly identify the issue and fix it.
