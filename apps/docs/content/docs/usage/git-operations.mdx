### Git Operations

At the end of the [execution pipeline] **nefi** will usually suggest to create a new branch with the changes it has made along with commiting it. This is done to keep the previous branch clean and to allow for easy rollback of the changes.

### Augmentations

1. [x] Creating a new branch with the changes
2. [x] Committing the changes with **subject** and **message** corresponding to the work done by **nefi** 
3. [x] Following the already existing style of naming branches and commits.
    - Respecting and following the branch naming style between `feat/name-of-the-feature` _(conventional-dash)_ or `name-of-the-feature` _(dash)_ or custom. The sample from previous branches counts up to 30 last branches
    - Detecting the commit naming convention and following it. The distinguish process is between [conventional-commits] or [imperative-mood]. The sample from previous commits counts up to 100 last commits
    - If no clear style is detected, **nefi** will fall back to [conventional-commits]
    - If there are not enough samples for branches, **nefi** will fall back to the conventional-dash style and for commits it will fall back to the [conventional-commits]

### Quality of Life features

1. [x] Detecting the `gpgsign` flag in the git config. Currently **nefi** will not sign the commit and skip the feature of commiting the changes but the new branch will still be created.
