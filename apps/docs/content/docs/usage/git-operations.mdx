### Git Operations

At the end of the [execution pipeline] **nefi** will usually suggest to create a new branch with the changes it has made along with committing it. This is done to keep the previous branch clean and to allow for easy rollback of the changes.

import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Won't this break my repository and version control?">
  No. In fact this module is designed specifically to make agent **not break** your repository and version control by its actions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I don't want the agent to access my online hosted repository">
    **nefi** **does not perform any remote actions** and it is extremely unlikely that it will in the future. It only works locally and
    performs git operations on the local repository and only when the working tree is clean _(all previous changes are either stashed or committed)_ 
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Augmentations

1. [x] Creating a new branch with the changes
2. [x] Committing the changes with **subject** and **message** corresponding to the work done by **nefi**
3. [x] Following the already existing style of naming branches and commits.
   - Respecting and following the branch naming style between `feat/name-of-the-feature` _(conventional-dash)_ or `name-of-the-feature` _(dash)_ or custom. The sample from previous branches counts up to 30 last branches
   - Detecting the commit naming convention and following it. The distinguish process is between [conventional-commits] or [imperative-mood]. The sample from previous commits counts up to 100 last commits
   - If no clear style is detected, **nefi** will fall back to [conventional-commits]
   - If there are not enough samples for branches, **nefi** will fall back to the conventional-dash style and for commits it will fall back to the [conventional-commits]

### Quality of Life features

1. [x] Detecting the `gpgsign` flag in the git config. Currently **nefi** will not sign the commit and skip the feature of commiting the changes but the new branch will still be created.
