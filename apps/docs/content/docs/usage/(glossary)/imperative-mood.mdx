### Git's Imperative Mood

The imperative mood is a powerful commit message convention widely adopted across Git repositories. It aligns with Git's own message style. It's probably one of the most popular conventions along with the [conventional-commits].

#### The Golden Rule

Your commit message should complete this sentence:
> If applied, this commit will ...

For example:
- "If applied, this commit will **add user authentication**"
- "If applied, this commit will **fix memory leak in worker pool**"

#### Examples Reference Table

| ✅ **Good** <br/> (Imperative) | ❌ **Bad** <br/> (Non-Imperative) | ❌❌ **Very Bad** <br/> (Vague/Non-Professional) |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Add login feature | ~~Added login feature~~ | ~~Made auth work~~ |
| Fix memory leak | ~~Fixed the bug~~ | ~~Oops, bug fixes~~ |
| Update documentation | ~~Updating the docs~~ | ~~Docs stuff~~ |
| Remove deprecated API | ~~Removed old methods~~ | ~~Cleanup~~ |
| Refactor user service | ~~Refactoring service~~ | ~~Better code~~ |
| Optimize database queries | ~~Optimized queries~~ | ~~DB perf improvements~~ |
| Implement password reset | ~~Implemented password reset~~ | ~~Password thing~~ |
| Merge feature branch | ~~Merged the branch~~ | ~~Finally done!~~ |
| Test edge cases | ~~Testing edge cases~~ | ~~More tests~~ |
| Configure CI pipeline | ~~Configured CI~~ | ~~CI stuff working now~~ |

#### Additional Good Examples
- Add input validation to login form
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Upgrade dependencies to latest versions
- Initialize Docker configuration
- Migrate database to PostgreSQL
- Resolve merge conflicts in user module
- Document API authentication process

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ~~Fixed the thing that was broken~~
- ~~Changing some stuff~~
- ~~Updates and improvements~~
- ~~Quick fix~~
- ~~WIP~~
- ~~Various changes~~
- ~~Minor tweaks~~

Remember: The commit body can use any style you prefer, but the subject line must use the imperative mood to maintain consistency and clarity.
