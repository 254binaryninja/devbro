### Git's Imperative Mood

The imperative mood is an classic commit naming convention followed by loads of the repositories. It's one of the most popular ones standing near the [conventional-commits].
On this page you will find a brief explanation of the convention and a list of examples.

In keeping with the standard output of git itself, all commit subject lines must be written using the imperative:

- **Good ✅**
    - **Refactor subsystem X for readability**
    - **Update getting started documentation**
    - **Remove deprecated methods**
    - **Release version 1.0.0**
- ~~Bad~~ ❌
    - ~~Fixed bug with Y~~
    - ~~Changing behavior of X~~
- ~~Very Bad~~ ❌❌
    - ~~More fixes for broken stuff~~
    - ~~Sweet new API methods~~

Your commit subject line must be able to complete the sentence

> If applied, this commit will ...

If it doesn't, it's non-conformant. The body may use any style you want.
