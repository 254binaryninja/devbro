# Introduction 

<ClerkLogo/>


[Clerk](https://clerk.com/) is a powerful authentication solution that allows you to manage users in your application. Some of the features that make it stand out are:

- Fast and reliable delivery of one-time passcodes.
- Pixel-perfect, beautiful UI
- Magic links and social sign-ins
- Modern framework SDK's and tons of integrations.
- Built-in brute force and fraud prevention to enhance security.
- Multi-tenancy and organization support in a B2B space

and much more! Explore it [here](https://clerk.com/).

## Integration

`nefi` will automatically prompt user about Clerk integration if he wants to integrate the auth into the project. If user accepts, `nefi` will do do the following:

1. Add Clerk provider and auth components into root layout
2. Add Clerk middleware with route protection rules
3. Add Clerk env variables to the project (using keyless setup flow)

Everything in result will require exactly 0 attention from the developer.
