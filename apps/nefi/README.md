**nefi /ˈnɛfi/** is an AI agent that automates code management and feature integration in Next.js codebases _(primarily [next-enterprise] repository)_ through natural language commands, handling everything from git operations to package management and file modification.

Learn more in our [documentation (nefi.ai)](https://nefi.ai/)

## Motivation

The whole idea behind this tool is to reduce the amount of manual work and time spent on common tasks like setting up the [next-enterprise] boilerplate for your personal needs. It is common that not every application requires e.g. storybook integration (althought we love it!). **nefi** allows you to just type `remove storybook from my project` and it will be done.
